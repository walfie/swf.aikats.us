1. Convert SWF to HTML file with [Swiffy](https://developers.google.com/swiffy/convert/upload)

2. Extract the part of the script that defines `swiffyobject`, save it as a js file in the `js` directory

3. View `index.html#filename` in a browser (where `filename` is the js file without the `.js` extension)
